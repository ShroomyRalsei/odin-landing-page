# odin-landing-page
Landing page assigned by the odin project as the final project before getting into javascript, lol.

The purpose of this page is to apply the flexbox skills i was taught by the odin project over this last week or so, and make a cool landing page that fits the assignment's criteria.

The pictures in this project were taken from the following links:
